## ATM Software with GUI

This project is an ATM software implemented in Python using the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various banking operations such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, Fawry services, and password change.

# Features
# Account Authentication: 
Users can enter their account number and password to access their accounts. Failed attempts are tracked, and after three unsuccessful attempts, the account is locked.

# Cash Withdrawal: 
Users can initiate cash withdrawal by entering the desired amount. The system validates the withdrawal amount, checks the account balance, and performs the withdrawal if the conditions are met.

# Balance Inquiry: 
Users can view their account balance by selecting the balance inquiry option. The system displays the account holder's name and current balance.

# Fawry Services: 
Users can access Fawry services such as Orange recharge, Etisalat recharge, Vodafone recharge, and We recharge. This feature allows users to conveniently recharge their mobile phone accounts.

# Password Change: 
Users can change their account password by entering a new password and confirming it. The system verifies the entered passwords, enforces a four-digit length, and updates the password if the conditions are met.
