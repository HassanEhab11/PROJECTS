# Smart Home Project based on FreeRTOS 

Here's an overview of the components and features you've described:

## 1. **Home Automation System:**
   - The core of this project is a home automation system that integrates various sensors, actuators, and control mechanisms to enhance home security, convenience, and energy efficiency.

## 2. **Password-Protected Door Control:**
   - we implemented a password-protected door control system. This using a keypad  where users must enter a password to unlock or lock the door.

## 3. **Gas Detection:**
   - this system includes gas detection sensors to monitor gas leaks in the home. If a gas leak is detected, the system trigger an alarm actions to ensure safety.

## 4. **Automatic Window Control:**
   - This system has the capability to automatically control window. This could be based on various factors, such as time of day, light intensity, or user preferences.

## 5. **Temperature-Based Fan Control:**
   - Also implemented a temperature-based fan control system. When the temperature in a room exceeds a certain threshold, the system activates a fan to regulate the temperature and improve comfort.

## 6. **FreeRTOS Integration:**
   - FreeRTOS (Real-Time Operating System) serves as the underlying software framework for smart home project. It provides task scheduling, inter-task communication, and other real-time features to ensure the system's responsiveness and reliability.

## 7. **User Interface:**
   - We used LCD as  a user interface through which homeowners can monitor and control various aspects of the smart home system. This could be a mobile app in future update .

## 8. **Security and Authentication:**
   - Password protection for door control adds a layer of security to the system, ensuring that only authorized users can access the home.

## 9. **Safety Features:**
   - The gas detection system enhances safety by promptly identifying gas leaks and taking appropriate measures to mitigate risks.

## 10. **Energy Efficiency:**
   - The automatic window and temperature-based fan control features contribute to energy efficiency by optimizing the use of natural light and regulating heating and cooling systems.

## 12. **Scalability:**
  - this project can potentially be expanded by adding more sensors, actuators, and automation features to further enhance the functionality and convenience of the smart home.
